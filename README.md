# odin-recipes

First project in the Foundational course of TOP.

<b>Pre-completion</b>: Will demonstrate basic HTML to include links, underordered/ordered lists, and images.
<b>Post-completion</b>: Some good practice on the basics of HTML and Git. Learned about headers
and descriptions on commits, as well as the 'target' and 'rel' attributes.
